# Fencing Scoring Machine Implementation

This is code for my final project for ENGR 015: Fundamentals of Digital and 
Embedded Systems at Swarthmore College, Fall 2021. It is an 
implementation of the timing rules for an electric fencing scoring machine as 
detailed in the [USA Fencing Rules for Competition](https://cdn2.sportngin.com/attachments/document/f840-2248253/2020-08_USA_Fencing_Rules.pdf),
Appendix B ("Characteristics of Scoring Apparatus"), using an Adafruit 
CircuitPlayground.
